What is Git -> open source and free source control software

Git is used to manage files over time -> see past versions and see the new updates

NONE GIT COMMAND BUT ESSENTIAL:

cd - change directory -> allows to navigate through folders where you want git tracking

example of cd

cd ~ /projects/my-app1 -> this changes the directory of the git to the file named 'my-app1' which is in
folder 'projects' within the current directory


how to initialise git:

git init


git add .- NOTE . means all files(curr directory) and subfiles whereas * means only files in the current directory
. = current directory -> git scans the folders and stages, new files(previously untracked)

git commit -m "Initial commit"


git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git


git push -u origin main




when you want to update a file - webpage in this example "eggs are bad" on the webpage i create a branch
off the main essentially another duplicate of the main branch and make any updates ensuring that the main
branch is safe -> how to do this ->

git branch <branch-name> && git checkout <branch-name>: first line creates the branch into ur git and 
second line makes it so your next commits will be within the specific <branch-name> - switching the place
commits


or newer version of git

git checkout -b <branch-name> : essentially the same thing just in 1 line of cmd



once the made changes on the branch are good i could merge them and create a new/updated main branch
